# getquaRtiles: Quickly Computing the Quartiles of Tidy Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

getquaRtiles allows you to easily view the quartiles of numerical data.


## Installation

You can install the development version of getquaRtiles from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2023/getquaRtiles", ref = "0.1.1")
```

## Example

The basic usage of getquaRtiles is as follows:
```{r example}
library(getquaRtiles)

# Inspect the dataset
head(mtcars)

# Let's get the quartiles of weight over the whole dataset
get_quartiles(mtcars,wt)

# Let's do the same thing, now splitting up the dataset by the number of cylinders 
get_quartiles(mtcars,wt,cyl) 
```
